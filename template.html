                <p class="card-text"> Initially developed by Macromedia, a graphics,
                    multimedia and web development software company and purchased in 2005 by
                    <a href='https://www.adobe.com/devnet/rtmp.html'>Adobe Inc.</a> the current rights owner,
                    Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) was used for audio streaming. Right after,
                    it became popular and was used for video streaming as it provides low-latency content.
                    The data stream used to flow between a source and a server, previously the Flash player and the
                    Flash server.
                    Each video and audio document is sent from the source to the server into a reversible small web
                    format (swf) file.
                    Users who desire to watch the stream request the server (fig 6).
                    However, from the server to the users, the used protocol isn’t RTMP but other ones such as Dash or
                    HLS and are not detailed in this section.
                    <br>
                    Actually, not every device support Flash technology, Apple might be the precursor
                    for <a href='https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/'>not using</a>
                    Flash technology on their mobile devices as it is a 100% proprietary technology, which means is
                    owned entirely by one entity.
                    Currently, new applications don't use Adobe Flash anymore and
                    it will be officially deprecated on December 31, 2020 and HTML5 appears to be the solution.

                        The beginning of each RTMP connection is started by a handshake.
                        To initialise the handshake, the client sends the C0 and C1 chunks. C0 chunk contains
                        version information, while C1 contains synchronization parameters and random data. C2 is sent
                        when the client receives S1 and consists in verification that sums up the previous chunks.
                        The chunked messages are all in a constant size: 1 byte for C0 and S0, 1536 bytes for the
                        others.

                        web
                        by a Flash plugin. Flash Player is a browser plugin to run applications inside a webpage. The
                        Flash .swf
                        application uses code to load the RTMP data and the Flash Player system will automatically
                        decode
                        that into live audio/video. To ensure smooth video streaming despite bandwidth fluctuations,
                        RTMP keeps the connection between the streaming server and the video player continuously open
                        during the process. Audio, video and others data are delivered separately and are broken into
                        segments by the protocol to be transmitted with consistence. These segments have the same
                        duration
                        and allow to adapt the stream according to the quality of the connection of the client. <br>
                        Nowadays with the deprecation of flash, RTMP will not be used for video delivery to end users
                        anymore when doing a live stream with a content delivery network CDN. RTMP will stream the content to a server and then
                        the stream will be transformed to HLS(cf figure 3).

                    <h6>Advantages</h6>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                        RTMP is useful for streaming live content at a low latency, offering adaptative bitrate streaming (ABS)
                        which means it provides the best quality according to the viewers internet speed.
                        It is amongst the best in providing multicast support since it allows to deliver a stream to many
                        users without initiating a connection for each of them.  <br>
                        In fact, there is a direct pointer from the server to the player and the latter only consider
                        data corresponding to that pointer and doesn’t rely on any buffer to cache files locally on the
                        user computer. Thus the server and the player are in a constant connection with adaptative
                        bitrate streaming and monitoring can provide
                        precise and specific statistics about what a user did during the video.

                    <h6>Disadvantages</h6>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                        The drawbacks said in the introduction section are RTMP cannot be ran on iDevices and HTML5 cannot play RTMP.
                        Due to its default usage of 1935 port, RTMP is not accessible when restrictive firewalls are working.
                        RTMP is vulnerable to bandwidth issue, the stream requires a minimum internet speed.
                        The latency is slightly increased as the server has to process the RTMP stream and then follows
                        Dash or HLS protocol to satisfy the clients stream demands.

                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                        The main feature of RTMP is to provide an adaptive bitrate streaming service where users can do
                        live streams and deliver them to several platforms(cf figure 4). In the case of a video
                        streaming, the streamer
                        may ask the service provider to be able to read the user chat and be able to communicate with
                        viewers.
                        This requires a low-latency real time messaging protocol, RTMP. Flash player may be discontinued
                        but the gaming community still uses it. On the users side, they do not want an data to be
                        temporarily
                        stored in the dedicated browser folder in their computers and would rather stay on sync with
                        the stream and not see lost frames. The users prefer low quality videos over a laggy stream,
                        their priority is to be able to see what the player is doing and comment it in as little time
                        as possible. This protocol’s pointer is always on sync with the stream, therefore, it does not
                        display in-time lost content and causes cumulative delays.
                        Unlike other progressive media players, there is none to very little buffering in RTMP, user
                        experience
                        is optimized, and poor network statistics are accounted for. This use case’s aim is to display
                        the low latency and adaptation to bandwidth changes RTMP is able to provide.

                <h2 class="card-title">Introduction</h2>
                This part explains how to deploy the project with three elements which are described. You need at least two
                computers: one for the deployment of the source and the server and another one for the client.
                <img src="./images/architecture.png">
                <center><h5 class="card-title">Figure 6</h5></center>
                <br>
                In the figure 6, the classical architecture of RTMP is presented. The latter involves three actors:
                <ul>
                    <li>A <b>source</b>: is the one that wants to broadcast the video. To do this, it sends an RTMP
                        stream to the second actor, which corresponds to the server.</li>
                    <li>An <b>RTMP Media Server</b>: is the receiver of the RTMP stream. It converts the stream into
                        another format which is supported by HTML5 and sends it to clients who ask the stream.</li>
                    <li>A <b>client</b>: is the one who wants to see the stream. To do this, he asks the RTMP Media
                        Server and he receives the RTMP stream converted in another format which is then displayed in
                        its browser. </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                In our case, the conversion is not done by the RTMP Media Server but with the player available in the
                webpage. It converts the RTMP stream into MP4 segments and feeds the segments into an HTML5 video
                element.
                We used the <a href="https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/">flv.js</a> player to display the stream.

                <a href="https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server">Node Media Server</a> is a Node.js
                implementation of RTMP Media Server. Other protocols are available through this library.
                This server was chosen for the demonstration because it can be run whether on MacOS or Linux.
                <hr>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Node Media Server is not the most famous solution for the RTMP Server. You can
                use <a href="https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module">Arut's project</a> which is based on an NGINX
                server and simple to implement.
                Nevertheless, it will not be easily portable on macOS as it needs libraries which are not available on

                <br>
                <code><strong>node app.js</strong></code>
                <br>
